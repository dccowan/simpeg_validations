    "[MAG3D v6.0](https://mag3d.readthedocs.io/en/v6/) is a voxel cell magnetic forward modeling and inversion package developed by the UBC Geophysical Inversion Facility. This software is proprietary and can ONLY be acquired through appropriate [academic](https://gif.eos.ubc.ca/software/licenses_academic) or [commerical](https://gif.eos.ubc.ca/software/licenses_commercial) licenses. The numerical approach of the forward simulation is described in the [online manual's theory section](https://mag3d.readthedocs.io/en/v6/content/theory.html).
