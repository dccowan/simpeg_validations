# ## Simulating Pole-Dipole DC Resistivity Data over a Conductive and a Resistive Block
# 
# Pole-dipole induced polarization data are simulated over a conductive and chargeable block and over a resistive block. The background is non-chargeable and has a conductivity is $\sigma_0$ = 0.01 S/m. The conductive-chargeable block has a conductivity of $\sigma_c$ = 0.1 S/m and an intrinsic chargeability of $\eta_c$ = 0.1 V/V. The resistor is non-chargeable and has a conductivity of $\sigma_r$ = 0.001 S/m. Both blocks are oriented along the Northing direction and have x, y and z dimensions of 400 m, 1600 m and 320 m. Both blocks are buried at a depth of 160 m.
# 
# Apparent chargeability data are simulated with a pole-dipole configuration. The survey consists of 9 West-East survey lines, each with a length of 2000 m. The line spacing is 250 m and the electrode spacing is 100 m.

# ## UBC-GIF DCIP OcTree Package Details
# 
# [DCIP OcTree](https://dcipoctree.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) is a voxel cell DC/IP forward modeling and inversion package developed by the UBC Geophysical Inversion Facility. This software is proprietary and can ONLY be acquired through appropriate [commerical](https://gif.eos.ubc.ca/software/licenses_commercial) licenses. The numerical approach of the forward simulation is described in the [online manual's theory section](https://dcipoctree.readthedocs.io/en/latest/content/theory.html). If you have a valid license, there are instructions for reproducing the results (add link).

# ## Running the Forward Simulation

# ### Step 1: Acquiring a commercial or academic license.
# 
# - Explain and link to where you would get licenses. Make ABSOLUTELY CLEAR we don't just give out the licenses willy-nilly.

# ### Step 2: Downloading and extracting assets
# 
# - Link and instructions for download

# ### Step 3: Running the forward modeling executable
# 
# - Brief description of what files are needed
# - Link to the manual page where we run the forward simulation
