# =====================
# 
# ## Simulating Gradiometry Data Over a Block in a Halfspace
# 
# Gradiometry data are simulated for a density contrast model over block in a halfspace. The density contrast of the background is 0 $g/cm^3$ and the density contrast of the block is 0.1 $g/cm^3$. The dimensions of the block in the x, y and z directions are all 200 m. The block is buried at a depth of 200 m.
# 
# Gradiometry data are simulated on a regular grid of points at a heigh of 1 m above the Earth's surface. The station spacing is 50 m in both the X and Y directions.

# ## UBC-GIF GG3D v6.0 Package Details
# 
# [GG3D v6.0.1](https://gg3d.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) is a voxel cell gravity gradiometry forward modeling and inversion package developed by the UBC Geophysical Inversion Facility. This software is proprietary and can ONLY be acquired through appropriate [academic](https://gif.eos.ubc.ca/software/licenses_academic) or [commerical](https://gif.eos.ubc.ca/software/licenses_commercial) licenses. The numerical approach of the forward simulation is described in the [online manual's theory section](https://gg3d.readthedocs.io/en/latest/content/theory.html). If you have a valid license, the steps for reproducing the simulating results are explained below. 

# ## Running the Forward Simulation

# ### Step 1: Acquiring a commercial or academic license.
# 
# - Explain and link to where you would get licenses. Make ABSOLUTELY CLEAR we don't just give out the licenses willy-nilly.

# ### Step 2: Downloading and extracting assets
# 
# - Link and instructions for download

# ### Step 3: Running the forward modeling executable
# 
# - Brief description of what files are needed
# - Link to the manual page where we run the forward simulation
