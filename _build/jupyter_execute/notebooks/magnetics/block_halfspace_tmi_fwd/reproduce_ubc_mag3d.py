# ===============================
# 
# ## Simulating TMI Data Over a Susceptible Block in a Halfspace
# 
# Total magnetic intensity (TMI) data are simulated over susceptible block using SimPEG. The background susceptibility is 0.0001 SI and the susceptibility of the block is 0.025 SI. The dimensions of the block in the x, y and z directions are all 200 m. The block is buried at a depth of 200 m.
# 
# TMI data are simulated on a regular grid of points for an airborne survey. The receiver height is set to be 30 m above the surface. The station spacing is 50 m in both the X and Y directions.

# ## UBC-GIF MAG3D v6.0 Package Details
# 
# [MAG3D v6.0](https://mag3d.readthedocs.io/en/v6/) is a voxel cell magnetic forward modeling and inversion package developed by the UBC Geophysical Inversion Facility. This software is proprietary and can ONLY be acquired through appropriate [academic](https://gif.eos.ubc.ca/software/licenses_academic) or [commerical](https://gif.eos.ubc.ca/software/licenses_commercial) licenses. The numerical approach of the forward simulation is described in the [online manual's theory section](https://mag3d.readthedocs.io/en/v6/content/theory.html). If you have a valid license, there are instructions for reproducing the results (add link). 

# ## Running the Forward Simulation

# ### Step 1: Acquiring a commercial or academic license.
# 
# - Explain and link to where you would get licenses. Make ABSOLUTELY CLEAR we don't just give out the licenses willy-nilly.

# ### Step 2: Downloading and extracting assets
# 
# - Link and instructions for download

# ### Step 3: Running the forward modeling executable
# 
# - Brief description of what files are needed
# - Link to the manual page where we run the forward simulation
