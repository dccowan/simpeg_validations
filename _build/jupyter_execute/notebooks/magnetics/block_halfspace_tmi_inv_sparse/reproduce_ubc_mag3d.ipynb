    "\n",
    "Here, we inverted total magnetic intensity (TMI) data collected over a block within a homogeneous halfspace. We invert for a compact and blocky model using an iteratively re-weighted least-squares inversion approach. The problem is bounded to enforce positivity in the recovered susceptibility model.\n",
    "\n",
    "The true model consists of a susceptible block (0.025 SI) within a minimally susceptible halfspace (0.0001 SI).\n",
    "The dimensions of the block in the x, y and z directions were are all 200 m. The block was buried at a depth of 200 m. The Earth's inducing field had an inclination of 65 degrees, a declination of 25 degrees and an intensity of 50,000 nT.\n",
    "\n",
    "The data being inverted were generated using the [UBC MAG3D v6.0.1 code](https://mag3d.readthedocs.io/en/v6/). Synthetic TMI data were simulated within a 1000 m by 1000 m region at an elevation of 30 m; the center of which lied directly over the center of the block. The station spacing was 50 m in both the X and Y directions. Observed data were sythnetically created by adding Gaussian noise with a standard deviation of 1 nT to the simulated data. A floor uncertainty of 1 nT was assigned to the observed data."
