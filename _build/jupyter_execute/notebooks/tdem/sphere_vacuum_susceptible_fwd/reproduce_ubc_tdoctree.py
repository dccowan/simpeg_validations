# =======================
# 
# ## Simulating Transient Response over a Conductive and Susceptible Sphere
# 
# Here we simulate the transient response from a conductive sphere in a vacuum. The sphere has a conductivity of $\sigma$ = 10 S/m and a magnetic susceptibility of $\chi$ = 9 SI. The center of the sphere is located at (0,0,-50) and has a radius of $a$ = 8 m.
# 
# The transient response is simulated for x, y and z oriented magnetic dipoles at (-5, 0, 10). The x, y and z components of H and dB/dt are simulated at (5, 0, 10). However, we only plot the data for horizontal coaxial, horizontal coplanar and vertical coplanar geometries.

# ## UBC-GIF Package Details
# 
# There are two packages capable of modeling TEM data on OcTree meshes. These are:
# 
# **UBC TD Octree v1:** [TD OcTree v1](https://tdoctree.readthedocs.io/en/tdoctree_v1/) is a voxel cell TDEM forward modeling and inversion package developed by the UBC Geophysical Inversion Facility. This software is proprietary and can ONLY be acquired through appropriate [academic](https://gif.eos.ubc.ca/software/licenses_academic) or [commerical](https://gif.eos.ubc.ca/software/licenses_commercial) licenses. The numerical approach of the forward simulation is described in the [online manual's theory section](https://tdoctree.readthedocs.io/en/tdoctree_v1/content/theory.html). If you have a valid license, there are instructions for reproducing the results (add link).
# 
# **UBC TD Octree v2:** [TD OcTree v2](https://tdoctree.readthedocs.io/en/tdoctree_v2/) is a voxel cell TDEM forward modeling and inversion package developed by the UBC Geophysical Inversion Facility. This software is proprietary and can ONLY be acquired through appropriate [academic](https://gif.eos.ubc.ca/software/licenses_academic) or [commerical](https://gif.eos.ubc.ca/software/licenses_commercial) licenses. The numerical approach of the forward simulation is described in the [online manual's theory section](https://tdoctree.readthedocs.io/en/tdoctree_v2/content/theory.html). If you have a valid license, there are instructions for reproducing the results (add link).

# ## Running the Forward Simulation

# ### Step 1: Acquiring a commercial or academic license.
# 
# - Explain and link to where you would get licenses. Make ABSOLUTELY CLEAR we don't just give out the licenses willy-nilly.

# ### Step 2: Downloading and extracting assets
# 
# - Link and instructions for download

# ### Step 3: Running the forward modeling executable
# 
# - Brief description of what files are needed
# - Link to the manual page where we run the forward simulation
