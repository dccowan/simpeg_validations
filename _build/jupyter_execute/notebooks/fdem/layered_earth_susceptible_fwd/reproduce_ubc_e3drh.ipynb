    "Secondary magnetic fields are simulated over a conductive 1D layered Earth. From the top layer down we define 3 layers with electrical conductivities $\\sigma_1$ = 0.05 S/m, $\\sigma_2$ = 0.5 S/m and $\\sigma_3$ = 0.05 S/m. The magnetic susceptibilities of the layers are $\\chi_1$ = 1 SI, $\\chi_2$ = 0 SI and $\\chi_2$ = 1 SI. The thicknesses of the top two layers are both 64 m.\n",
