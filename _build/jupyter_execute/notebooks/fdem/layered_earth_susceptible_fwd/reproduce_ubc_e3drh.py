# ## Simulating Secondary Magnetic Field Data over a Conductive and Susceptible Layered Earth
# 
# Secondary magnetic fields are simulated over a conductive 1D layered Earth. From the top layer down we define 3 layers with electrical conductivities $\sigma_1$ = 0.05 S/m, $\sigma_2$ = 0.5 S/m and $\sigma_3$ = 0.05 S/m. The magnetic susceptibilities of the layers are $\chi_1$ = 1 SI, $\chi_2$ = 0 SI and $\chi_2$ = 1 SI. The thicknesses of the top two layers are both 64 m.
# 
# Secondary magnetic fields are simulated for x, y and z oriented magnetic dipole sources at (0,0,5). For each source, the x, y and z components of the response are simulated at (10,0,5).

# ## UBC-GIF E3DRH v1 and v2 Package Details
# 
# UBC-GIF has two coding packages capable of modeling 3D FEM data on OcTree meshes. These are:
# 
# **UBC E3DRH v1:** [E3DRH v1](https://e3drh.readthedocs.io/en/e3drh/) is a voxel cell FDEM forward modeling and inversion package developed by the UBC Geophysical Inversion Facility. This software is proprietary and can ONLY be acquired through appropriate [commerical](https://gif.eos.ubc.ca/software/licenses_commercial) license. The numerical approach of the forward simulation is described in the [online manual's theory section](https://e3drh.readthedocs.io/en/e3drh/content/theory.html). If you have a valid license, there are instructions for reproducing the results (add link).
# 
# **UBC E3DRH v2:** [E3DRH v2](https://e3drh.readthedocs.io/en/e3drh_v2/) is a voxel cell FDEM forward modeling and inversion package developed by the UBC Geophysical Inversion Facility. This software is proprietary and can ONLY be acquired through appropriate [commerical](https://gif.eos.ubc.ca/software/licenses_commercial) license. The numerical approach of the forward simulation is described in the [online manual's theory section](https://e3drh.readthedocs.io/en/e3drh_v2/content/theory.html). If you have a valid license, there are instructions for reproducing the results (add link).

# ## Running the Forward Simulation

# ### Step 1: Acquiring a commercial or academic license.
# 
# - Explain and link to where you would get licenses. Make ABSOLUTELY CLEAR we don't just give out the licenses willy-nilly.

# ### Step 2: Downloading and extracting assets
# 
# - Link and instructions for download

# ### Step 3: Running the forward modeling executable
# 
# - Brief description of what files are needed
# - Link to the manual page where we run the forward simulation
