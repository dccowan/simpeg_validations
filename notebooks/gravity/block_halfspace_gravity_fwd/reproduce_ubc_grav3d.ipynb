    "Gravity anomaly data are simulated for a density contrast model over block in a halfspace. The density contrast of the background is 0 $g/cm^3$ and the density contrast of the block is 0.1 $g/cm^3$. The dimensions of the block in the x, y and z directions are all 200 m. The block is buried at a depth of 200 m.\n",

    "[GRAV3D v6.0.1](https://grav3d.readthedocs.io/en/v6.0/) is a voxel cell gravity forward modeling and inversion package developed by the UBC Geophysical Inversion Facility. This software is proprietary and can ONLY be acquired through appropriate [academic](https://gif.eos.ubc.ca/software/licenses_academic) or [commerical](https://gif.eos.ubc.ca/software/licenses_commercial) licenses. The numerical approach of the forward simulation is described in the [online manual's theory section](https://grav3d.readthedocs.io/en/v6.0/content/theory.html). If you have a valid license, the steps for reproducing the simulating results are explained below. "
